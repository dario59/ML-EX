# ML-EX

The objective of this analysis is just to mess with data. I've downloaded a dataset with historic weather data for my city, then imported in a DBMS and calculated the proabilities for apply the Hidden Markov Model. Then ofc I've apply it, to see what the prediction for weather will look like.

All the code is written in Python 3.X, in a Collab Notebook, using Tensorflow. Dataset is from Open Data provided by SIR - Regione Toscana http://www.sir.toscana.it/consistenza-rete 
Code for model is mainly taken from Tensorflow documentation
