# ML-EX

The objective of this analysis is to create a model that correctly predict if a message is Spam or not. The analysis is based on spam.csv dataset, it contains a bunch of measurements used to identify if a message is spam or not and an historic series. You can reference the file spam_doc.docx for documentation about the dataset variables. I think linear regression could make a great work, from documentation we can evaluate there is a linear relationship between response variable and predictors. 

All the code is written in Python 3.X, in a Collab Notebook, using Tensorflow. Dataset courtesy by Mark Hopkins, Erik Reeber, George Forman, George Forman. Code for model is mainly taken from Tensorflow documentation.
